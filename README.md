## Features

### Services Implementation
The application demonstrates the use of Angular services for handling data logic, ensuring a modular and efficient structure.

### Pipes Utilization
I have utilized Angular pipes to transform and format data elegantly, improving the user experience.

### Local Storage for Persistent Data
Data persistence is achieved through local storage, allowing users to retain their preferences and information across sessions.

### Integration with Countries API
The application fetches data from the Countries API, providing users with information about different countries.

### Tailwind CSS Styling
Styling has been accomplished using Tailwind CSS, ensuring a modern and responsive design throughout the application.
